# Sailor Utility Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the development plan for expanding the Pi Server Project into a comprehensive sailor utility application. The system will track boats, events, maintenance records, equipment, and trip data with cross-referencing capabilities.

## Current System Architecture
- **Backend**: Flask with SQLAlchemy, JWT authentication
- **Frontend**: React with Vite
- **Database**: SQLite (app.db)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user management

## Frontend Architecture

### Modular Design Philosophy
The frontend will be built with a truly modular architecture where each feature module is:
- Developed in separate files/directories
- Dynamically loaded based on user permissions
- Configurable through admin settings
- Self-contained with their own components, services, and routing

### Left Navigation Bar Structure
```
┌─ Dashboard
├─ My Profile
├─ Fleet Management    [Module: boats]
├─ Trip Logbook       [Module: trips]
├─ Equipment Tracker  [Module: equipment]
├─ Maintenance Log    [Module: maintenance]
├─ Events Calendar    [Module: events]
├─ Weather & Routes   [Module: navigation]
├─ Crew Network      [Module: social]
└─ Admin Panel       [Module: admin] (admin only)
```

### Module System Architecture

#### Available Modules
1. **boats** - Fleet/Boat Management
2. **trips** - Trip Logging and GPS Tracking
3. **equipment** - Equipment Inventory
4. **maintenance** - Maintenance Records

  routes: [...],
  components: {
    Dashboard: BoatsDashboard,
    List: BoatsList,
