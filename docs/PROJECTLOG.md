# Project Development Log

## Overview
Full-stack web application development project for practicing GitHub-based deployment workflow from development machine to Raspberry Pi server.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Vite + React (development server)
- **Backend**: Python + Flask (API server)  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (scalable data storage)
- **Deployment**: Raspberry Pi (production server)

## Development Sessions

### 2025-06-20 (Session 1) - Project Initialization
**Objective**: Set up project foundation and authentication system planning

**Tasks Completed**:
- ✅ Created comprehensive README.md with setup instructions
- ✅ Established project structure documentation
- ✅ Created PROJECTLOG.md for tracking development progress

**Technical Decisions**:
- Using PostgreSQL for scalability over SQLite
- Vite chosen for faster development builds
- Flask for lightweight Python backend
- JWT tokens for authentication

**Development Notes**:
- Project structured for easy deployment to Raspberry Pi
- Environment variables planned for configuration

### 2025-06-20 (Session 2) - Sailor Utility Application Development
**Objective**: Transform basic auth system into comprehensive sailor utility application

**Major Accomplishments**:
- ✅ **Phase 1 Complete (8/8 tasks)**: Core System & Module Framework
  - Enhanced User model with sailor-specific fields (admin, certifications, sailing experience)
  - Created SystemModule, UserModulePermission, and UserPreference models
  - Implemented complete module management system in backend
  - Built modular frontend architecture with dynamic loading
  - Created left navigation bar with module-based rendering
  - Fixed JSX import errors and module registry paths

- ✅ **Phase 2 Complete (6/6 tasks)**: Database Schema & Core Models
  - Comprehensive Boat model with technical specifications, insurance, engine details
  - Advanced Equipment model with inventory tracking, warranties, condition monitoring
  - Detailed MaintenanceRecord model with cost tracking, scheduling, parts management
  - Complete Event model with registration, competition features, participant management
  - **NEW**: Comprehensive Trip model with GPS support, weather tracking, cost breakdown
  - **NEW**: GPSRoutePoint model with Haversine calculations, environmental data tracking
  - **NEW**: TripParticipant and EventParticipant relationship models

**Backend Infrastructure**:
- Complete SQLAlchemy models for all sailor entities (boats, equipment, maintenance, events, trips)
- Module management API with admin controls and user permissions
- User preference system for customizable interface
- Foreign key relationships and constraints across all models
- AdminScripts directory with grant_all_modules.py for user permission management

**Frontend Architecture**:
- Modular design with 9 modules: dashboard, boats, trips, equipment, maintenance, events, navigation, social, admin
- Dynamic module loading with permission checking
- React hooks for module management (useModules)
- ModularNav component with responsive design
- Module registry system with proper JSX file extensions
- Placeholder components for all modules with development status

**Technical Achievements**:
- 14/42 tasks completed (33% overall progress)
- Production PostgreSQL database deployment
- Comprehensive data models with business logic
- Permission-based modular frontend system
- Clean separation of concerns across components

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `/backend/models.py` - All core sailor models integrated
- `/backend/AdminScripts/grant_all_modules.py` - User permission management
- `/frontend/src/modules/` - Complete modular structure with 9 modules
- `/frontend/src/hooks/useModules.js` - Module management hook
- `/frontend/src/components/Navigation/ModularNav.jsx` - Main navigation
- `/frontend/src/components/ModuleLoader.jsx` - Dynamic component loader
- `/SAILOR_UTILITY_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` - Updated with completion status

**Ready for Phase 3**: Backend API Development with CRUD endpoints for all entities

## Authentication System Design

### Database Schema (Planned)
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
);
```

### API Endpoints (Planned)
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user info
- `PUT /api/auth/profile` - Update user profile

### Frontend Components (Planned)
- `LoginForm` - User login interface
- `RegisterForm` - User registration interface
- `AuthGuard` - Protected route wrapper
- `UserProfile` - User profile management
- `Navigation` - Main navigation with auth state

---

## Environment Setup

### Development Environment
- macOS development machine
- Node.js v18+
- Python 3.9+
- PostgreSQL installed locally

### Production Environment
- Raspberry Pi server
- Same tech stack as development
- systemd services for process management
- nginx for reverse proxy (future implementation)

---

## Git Workflow
1. Develop features locally
2. Test thoroughly 
3. Commit with descriptive messages
4. Push to GitHub repository
5. Pull on Raspberry Pi
6. Deploy and verify

---

## Current Status
**Phase**: Completed Phase 1 & 2 of Sailor Utility Development
**Focus**: Comprehensive sailor application with modular architecture
**Progress**: 14/42 tasks completed (33%) - Ready for Phase 3 (Backend API Development)

**Latest Achievements**:
- ✅ Complete modular frontend architecture with 9 modules
- ✅ Comprehensive database models for all sailor entities
- ✅ Trip logging with GPS support and route point tracking
- ✅ Permission-based module system with admin controls

**Next Session Goals**:
- Begin Phase 3: Implement CRUD endpoints for all entities
- Create API routes for boats, trips, equipment, maintenance, events
